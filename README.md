# Hi there, I'm Mark ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a skilled and passionate Go programmer, dedicated to building high-quality software and contributing to the open-source community. Here, you'll find a collection of my public repositories, showcasing my work and contributions.

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and exploring advanced Go programming techniques.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to impactful projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go, software development, and open-source contributions.

## Featured Projects

- [errpath](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/errpath): Creates detailed error paths, enabling users to generate comprehensive and helpful error messages, such as `components.schemas["Pet"].allOf[0]: invalid schema`, when traversing complex data structures.
- [jsonutil](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/jsonutil): Custom [JSON v2](https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json) marshaling and unmarshaling utilities for `time.Duration` and `url.URL` types in Go.
- [ordmap](https://github.com/MarkRosemaker/ordmap): Provides a generic ordered map implementation, primarily designed for [JSON v2](https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json) marshalling and unmarshalling. Includes helper functions to easily define your own custom ordered maps with minimal boilerplate code.

### API Libraries for Go

I develop and maintain comprehensive API libraries for Go, which you can find at [go-api-libs](https://github.com/go-api-libs).

- **OpenAPI Specifications**: Each library includes an OpenAPI file, which is crafted using a combination of official documentation, and enhanced with real sample requests and responses from the API itself. This approach ensures the specifications are exceptionally detailed and comprehensive.
- **Generation of Efficient Code**: The Go code within these libraries is generated directly from the OpenAPI files, ensuring that the code precisely mirrors the capabilities and structure of the API. This is all made possible by my proprietary generator, which ensures robustness and efficiency in your API calls.

By leveraging these libraries, developers can save time on setup and integration, benefit from up-to-date documentation, and enjoy a streamlined development experience with Go.

Some of the libraries include:
- [toggl](https://github.com/go-api-libs/toggl)
- [freepublicapis](https://github.com/go-api-libs/freepublicapis)

Feel free to explore and use these libraries for your projects!
